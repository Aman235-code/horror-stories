<h1>🌲 Voices in the Appalachian Mountains</h1>

<p>The Appalachian Mountains stretch across the eastern United States like the spine of something ancient — something watching. Locals say the trees whisper at night. But it’s not the wind.</p>

<p><strong>They say:</strong> “If you hear your name in the dark… don’t answer. It’s not who you think it is.”</p>

<h2>🌑 The Rule of the Woods</h2>

<p>In remote parts of Appalachia, strange stories are passed down like family recipes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Never whistle after dark.”</li>
  <li>“Don’t look into the trees if something calls your name.”</li>
  <li>“If you hear footsteps behind you, just keep walking.”</li>
</ul>

<p>They're not superstitions. They're warnings.</p>

<blockquote>
  "There's something in those woods... and it remembers you."
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>🚪 Missing Without a Trace</h2>

<p>People vanish in these mountains. Hikers. Campers. Entire groups.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No blood. No struggle. No remains.</li>
  <li>Phones found with photos of trees — blurred figures between them.</li>
  <li>Dogs won’t go past certain trails. Radios pick up whispers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some say there are cave systems deep below the mountain. And something ancient lives in them.</p>

<hr />

<h2>🕯️ The Mimics</h2>

<p>Legends speak of creatures that wear your voice like a mask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It might sound like your friend… until it asks you to follow it.</li>
  <li>It might cry like a baby… until you get too close.</li>
  <li>It might say “Help me.” But no one’s ever found after chasing that sound.</li>
</ul>

<p>They mimic to lure. They feed on curiosity. And once you answer — you’re theirs.</p>

<blockquote>
  "You won't feel the cold hands. You’ll just... disappear."
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>🌌 My Point of View</h2>

<p>I’ve always believed the world hides more than it shows. The Appalachian Mountains aren’t just beautiful — they’re hiding something vast, old, and intelligent.</p>

<p>The government doesn’t talk about the disappearances. Locals won’t talk after dark. And all the warnings? They’re real.</p>

<p>Something out there mimics us. And it’s not human.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p><strong>If you hike in the Appalachians…</strong> stay near the fire. Don’t wander. And if something calls your name from the woods —</p>

<p><em>Don’t answer it.</em></p>
