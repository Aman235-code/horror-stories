# The Bermuda Triangle Mystery

The **Bermuda Triangle**, also known as the **Devil's Triangle**, is an infamous region of the North Atlantic Ocean loosely bordered by Miami (Florida), Bermuda, and San Juan (Puerto Rico).  
For decades, it has been the subject of speculation, conspiracy theories, and supernatural claims due to a string of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.

## 1. Early Accounts and First Disappearances
Reports of mysterious vanishings date back to the early 20th century, though seafarers have told strange stories about the region for centuries.  
The area became widely known in 1945, when **Flight 19**, a squadron of five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers, disappeared during a routine training mission. All 14 crew members vanished, and a rescue aircraft sent to find them also disappeared—adding 13 more lives to the mystery.
