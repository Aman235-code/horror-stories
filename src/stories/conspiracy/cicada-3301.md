## 📢 The First Message

On January 4, 2012, an image appeared on an anonymous message board.  
The image simply said:

> “Hello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test.”

It was signed **“3301”** with a small cicada insect at the bottom.

No one knew who posted it. The post claimed there was **a hidden message in the image itself**.

## 🧩 The Puzzle That Went Global

The challenge turned out to be more than just a riddle. Solvers had to:

- **Decode hidden text** inside image files (using steganography).  
- Follow **GPS coordinates** around the world — from Poland to Hawaii to Australia.  
- Visit physical locations where posters with the cicada symbol were glued to streetlights and phone poles.  
- Use obscure books, cryptography, and even **Tor hidden services** on the dark web.

## 💻 The Dark Web Connection

Halfway through, the trail led to **a Tor hidden site** — accessible only through the dark web.  
There, a new set of cryptic messages awaited, involving:

- PGP encryption keys.  
- References to ancient manuscripts.  
- Discussions about freedom, privacy, and opposition to mass surveillance.

Some participants claim the final steps disappeared before they could finish.  
Others said they were “contacted privately” and **never heard from again**.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Theories

1. **Intelligence Agency Recruitment**  
   - Possibly the NSA, CIA, or MI6 searching for top cryptographers.

2. **Hacktivist Collective**  
   - A secret privacy-focused group recruiting like-minded individuals.

3. **Alternate Reality Game (ARG)**  
   - An elaborate internet art project — though no one has claimed credit.

4. **Something More Sinister**  
   - Some believe it was a filter to find and recruit for **illegal dark web operations**.

## 📅 The Disappearances

Cicada 3301 reappeared in 2013 and 2014 with new puzzles — then vanished.  
No official source has confirmed their purpose, and no “winner” has come forward.

To this day, no one knows who or what **Cicada 3301** really was.
