<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🩸 The Ordinary Face Everyone Knows</h2>
<p style="color:#ef4444;">
Across continents and languages, people report seeing the <strong>same ordinary-looking man</strong> in their dreams.
He doesn’t always speak. Sometimes he watches. Sometimes he warns. Sometimes he smiles—too widely.
</p>

<blockquote style="color:#ef4444;">
“Have you seen this man?” — a question posted online in forums and late-night threads, followed by drawings that look frighteningly similar.
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🌘 Common Patterns</h2>
<ul style="color:#ef4444;">
  <li>He appears at thresholds: <strong>doorways, train platforms, hospital corridors</strong>.</li>
  <li>He knows a private memory and <strong>mentions it before you do</strong>.</li>
  <li>His face looks <em>generic</em>—like a composite of a thousand strangers.</li>
  <li>When you wake up, <strong>you remember his eyebrows first</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🧠 The Theories</h2>
<p style="color:#ef4444;">
Some call it a glitch in human perception—<strong>a shared template</strong> the brain uses when it can’t render faces in dreams.
Others say he’s a <strong>thoughtform</strong> fed by collective fear, gaining detail the more we speak his name.
A few believe he’s real—<em>a visitor</em> who can step between dreams like rooms in a long hotel hallway.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🛑 Signs He’s Been There</h2>
<ol style="color:#ef4444;">
  <li>You wake with the taste of <strong>mint</strong> or <strong>iron</strong> in your mouth.</li>
  <li>Your phone shows a <strong>missed call</strong> at 3:17 AM with no number.</li>
  <li>Your mirror fogs for a moment, as if someone <strong>exhaled</strong> just behind you.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🕯️ A Failed Protection Ritual</h2>
<p style="color:#ef4444;">
Place salt at the door. Keep a glass of water by the bed. Whisper your name backward.
People try these things. They work—<em>until they don’t</em>.
He doesn’t always enter. Sometimes he waits just <strong>outside</strong> the dream, tapping the frame.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">👁️ If He Speaks</h2>
<p style="color:#ef4444;">
Witnesses say his voice is <em>wrong</em>—like your own thoughts played through a radio.
If he asks a question, do <strong>not</strong> answer with your real name.
If he offers a door, <strong>don’t look at the handle</strong>. That’s where the teeth are.
</p>

<blockquote style="color:#ef4444;">
“Do you remember me now?” — the phrase most often reported before waking

<h2 style="color:#ef4444;">🔻 Final Warning</h2>
<p style="color:#ef4444;">
If you’re reading this at night, cover your mirror. Turn your phone screen face-down. 
And if you dream tonight, <strong>do not run</strong>. Walk calmly. Close the door behind you.
Because if you run, he learns your <em>pace</em>.
</p>

<p style="color:#ef4444;"><strong>He finds people who look for him.</strong></p>
