# Bloody Mary

Bloody Mary is one of the most chilling **urban legends** whispered around the world. According to the tale, chanting her name three times in front of a mirror in a darkened room will summon a vengeful spirit. Children, teenagers, and even adults have dared to test this story — with terrifying results.

## The Ritual
The legend usually goes like this:
1. Enter a dark room with a mirror (most often a bathroom).
2. Light a single candle or stand in complete darkness.
3. Say "Bloody Mary" three times while staring into the mirror.

If the ritual is successful, the face of a terrifying woman is said to appear — sometimes covered in blood, sometimes screaming, and sometimes reaching out from the mirror itself.

## Origins
The true origins of the Bloody Mary legend are debated:
- Some connect it to **Queen Mary I of England**, nicknamed "Bloody Mary" for her persecution of Protestants.  
- Others believe it stems from **folklore about mirrors**, which were often thought to be gateways to the spirit world.  
- Still others see it as a **sleepover dare** that grew into a global myth.

## Sightings and Experiences
Over decades, countless children have claimed to see:
- A **woman’s bloody face** staring back from the glass.  
- A **phantom hand** scratching at the mirror.  
- Or, in some cases, **nothing at all** — but leaving participants with a spine-chilling fear.  

Whether real or imagined, the ritual has been linked to **psychological effects**, including hallucinations caused by staring into a mirror in dim light.

## Why Do People Still Try It?

## The Creepy Truth
While science explains the Bloody Mary effect as **Troxler’s Fading** (an optical illusion that makes features appear distorted when staring too long in dim light), believers insist that something far darker lurks behind the mirror.

Would you dare to say her name tonight?
