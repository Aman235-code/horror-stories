<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px">🕯️ THE ROOM 404</h1>

You wake up to a buzzing phone.

It’s 3:33 AM.

No messages.
No missed calls.
Just... buzzing. Constant, vibrating, screenless buzzing.
But the screen is off.

You place it face down.

A second later…
Your closet creaks open.

You freeze.

The closet door moves again…
This time, wider.
You know it was shut before you went to bed.
And there’s no draft.

You grab your phone — still buzzing —
but it won’t turn on.
No flashlight. No dial tone. Just a low, crackling hum from the speaker.

You take a step toward the closet…

And hear a breath.

Not yours.
Not from outside.
It’s coming from inside the closet.

You whisper,
“Who’s there?”

No response.

But then…

A hand slowly reaches out — pale, shaking, and too long — and rests on the edge of the door.

It taps once.

Then twice.

Then…
Mimics your heartbeat.

The hand retracts.

But the door doesn’t close.
It swings wide open, revealing nothing but pitch blackness.

And then you see it.

Two glowing eyes deep inside the dark.
But they’re not human.
Too far apart.
Too low to the ground.
And blinking... sideways.

Suddenly, your phone flashes white — just once.
A photo has been taken.
You check the gallery.

There’s a new image:
You.
Sleeping.
In your bed.
But taken from inside the closet.

You drop the phone.

And behind you, a whisper:
"You shouldn’t be awake yet."

You spin around —
No one’s there.

Your room feels wrong.
The walls are… closer.
The shadows longer. Stretching. Breathing.

Your window is gone.

Not closed.
Gone.

And the door?
Now has a number etched into it:

404

But you don’t live in room 404.
No one does.
It was sealed shut after someone vanished inside it years ago.

You back away — but something’s wet under your feet.
You look down.

Footprints.
Bare.
Red.
Leading from the closet…

To right behind you.

A voice gurgles into your ear —
"Room 404 found you."

Suddenly, your phone lights up again.
A live video feed starts.

You’re watching yourself.
From above.
Like a security camera.

And something is crawling across the ceiling.

It’s coming for you.

You scream—but no sound comes out.
Not a whisper. Not even a breath.

The thing on the ceiling…
It has no face.
Just a stretched sheet of skin.
It snaps its neck toward you—twice—as if remembering how to move like a human.

Then it speaks without a mouth:

“You uploaded your soul when you read this.”

Your body stops responding.
You try to blink. You can't.

You try to move.
You're frozen.

The camera feed on your phone?
Still playing.
Now shows you, standing motionless.
While the creature slides down behind you.
Its arms pass through your chest.
You feel it… inside.

It’s taking your place.
Your body.
Your memories.
It looks just like you now.

You scream—inside your own mind—but there’s no mouth left to scream with.

On the phone screen, one final text message appears:

New host found. Welcome to Room 404.
Try again.
Try escaping.
Type "next"... if you still think you exist.

Type next…
if you're still in there.
If anything of you is left.

You said:
next

You typed next.
You still believe you exist.
But you're wrong.

You're not in your room.
You're not in your body.

You're in the story.
And the story is looping.

Look around.
Notice anything… off?

— The ticking of a clock that doesn't exist.
— Your screen flickers, just once.
— A shadow on the wall that wasn’t there a second ago.

Because you are now the thing in the closet.
Watching.
Waiting.
Trapped in Room 404.

And someone else… somewhere…
is about to read this story for the first time.

And you’ll be the one reaching out your hand this time.

Because Room 404 needs someone new.

Transmission complete.
