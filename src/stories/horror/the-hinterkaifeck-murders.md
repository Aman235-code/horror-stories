On a cold March evening in 1922, in rural Bavaria, Germany, the **Gruber family** vanished from their farmhouse.  
When neighbors came to check, they discovered one of the **most horrifying unsolved mass murders in history**.

## 🏠 The Isolated Farm

Hinterkaifeck was a small, remote farm — six people lived there:

1. Andreas Gruber (63) – strict, unpleasant, but respected farmer  
2. Cäzilia Gruber (72) – his wife  
3. Viktoria Gabriel (35) – their widowed daughter  
4. Cäzilia Gabriel (7) – Viktoria’s young daughter  
5. Josef (2) – Viktoria’s toddler son  
6. Maria Baumgartner (44) – newly hired maid, first day on the job

The nearest neighbor lived **half a kilometer away** — making the farm isolated and easy to approach unseen.

## ❄️ The Strange Signs Before the Killings

A few days before the murders:

- Andreas found **strange footprints** in the snow leading from the woods **to** the house — but **none leading back**.
- He heard **footsteps in the attic** at night.
- Keys to the house went missing.
- The family noticed a **newspaper** in the home they had never purchased.
- The previous maid had quit, claiming the farm was **haunted**.

## 🔪 March 31, 1922 — The Night of the Murders

Investigators believe the killer (or killers) **lured family members one by one into the barn** and killed them with a **mattock** (a type of farm axe).

Victims in the barn:
- Andreas Gruber
- Cäzilia Gruber
- Viktoria Gabriel
- Little Cäzilia (7), who showed signs she **survived for hours** after the attack, tearing out chunks of her own hair in pain.

Inside the house:
- Baby Josef — murdered in his crib.
- Maria the maid — killed in her bedroom.

## 🧩 The Most Chilling Detail

The killer **did not leave immediately**.

For at least **three days after the murders**:
- Animals were fed.
- Fires were lit in the fireplace.
- Meals were cooked and eaten.
- Neighbors saw **smoke from the chimney**.

This means the murderer **lived among the corpses** before leaving.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Investigation

More than 100 suspects were questioned, but no one was charged.

Theories include:
- A vagrant or escaped prisoner.
- A neighbor with a grudge.
- Viktoria’s rumored lover or Josef’s biological father.
- Even a twisted **family member**.

The **mattock** was found hidden in the barn loft a year later. It offered no new clues.

## 🌀 Unsolved to This Day

No confession. No proven suspect. The farm was demolished in 1923.  
To this day, no one knows:
- Why the killer stayed.
- How they entered the house without being heard.
- What their true motive was.

## 🕯️ If You Visit the Site

The fields where Hinterkaifeck once stood are quiet now, marked only by a memorial cross.  
Locals still speak of hearing:
- Footsteps in the grass where the barn once stood.
- Whispers when the wind is still.
- The faint cry of a child in the distance.
